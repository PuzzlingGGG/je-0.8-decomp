# je-0.8-decomp
decompiled this all myself, its a bit ugly and more runnable out the game but mess around with it if you want

NOTE: the julians-editor-rebuild was an attempt to... well... rebuild it as html originally based on [this archive on the game on the wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20211116134349/https://h5.julianseditor.com/) (nonfunctional, but some parts were arhived, like the original settings.js) and so far ive started to implement some stuff but it is still unplayable, help as you want to but try to keep the code as close as to the original as possible

look in files/ for all the game code. its currently unusable and very broken, youll see a bunch of decompiled js modules under folders like Frame/, Game/, Scene/ and World/. these hold helpers, platform glue and the game scripts themselves. it does not work in the slightest and is a mess, so a cleaned up version will live in the `cleanup` branch whenever i get around to fixing it.
